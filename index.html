              World of Warcraft (WoW) is a massively multiplayer online
              role-playing game (MMORPG) released in 2004 by Blizzard
              Entertainment. Set in the Warcraft fantasy universe, World of
              Warcraft takes place within the world of Azeroth, approximately
              four years after the events of the previous game in the series,
              Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne.

            <p>
              World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade is the first expansion set
              for the MMORPG World of Warcraft. It was released on January 16,
              2007 at local midnight in Europe and North America, selling nearly
              2.4 million copies on release day alone and making it, at the
              time, the fastest-selling PC game released at that point.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The game added a substantial amount of new content into the game
              world, including the new continent of Northrend, home of the
              eponymous Lich King and his undead minions. In order to advance
              through Northrend, players are required to reach at least level 68
              and the level cap for the expansion is 80. The first hero class
              was introduced, the Death Knight, that starts at level 55.

            <p>
              With the release of Cataclysm, the maximum player level has been
              raised from 80 to 85. The game's two main continents, Kalimdor and
              Eastern Kingdoms have been redesigned with a changed appearance,
              including flooded areas and lava canals, and some new areas. The
              quest system has been refreshed with almost 3500 new quests along
              with new and streamlined low and mid-level quests to complement
              the redesigned areas of Azeroth.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Mists of Pandaria raised the existing level cap from level 85 to
              90. It introduced a new character class, the monk, along with a
              new playable race, the Pandaren. The vanity pet system was
              overhauled and a pet battle system was added. Scenarios were
              introduced, and Challenge Modes were added for dungeons. The
              existing talent trees were replaced by a new system of tiered
              talents awarded every 15 levels.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The expansion raised the existing level cap from 90 to 100 and
              introduced player-built, upgradeable garrisons. Most of the player
              models were updated to have more detailed textures, animations and
              facial expressions, thus increasing the system requirements of the
              game.

            <p>
              The expansion raises the existing level cap from 100 to 110,
              features artifact weapons for each class's specializations,
              includes a new area on Azeroth called the Broken Isles and
              introduces the demon hunter hero class that starts at level 98. It
              initially included ten 5-man dungeons and two raids.

            <p>
              In addition to raising the level cap from 110 to 120, the
              expansion introduces the Kul Tiras and Zandalar continents and
              four allied races for both the Alliance and the Horde, while also
              adding dungeons and raids, warfronts, and uncharted islands.

            <p>
              The expansion opens up the Shadowlands, the realm of the dead in
              Warcraft lore. It features the game's first "level squish" and a
              completely overhauled leveling system, access to the Death Knight
              class for the races that did not previously have access to it,
              Covenants in the new zones, and new dungeons and raids.
